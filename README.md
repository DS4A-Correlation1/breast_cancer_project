## Goal

This project was done as part of the requirements for Correlation One's Data Science For All / Women Program. Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women. Through this project we analyse several risk factors that determine the presence of invasive breast cancer and classify breast histopathology and ultrasound scans.

## Datasets
- Risk Factors Estimation Dataset consists of risk factor data (e.g. age, race, age at first birth, etc.) from
280,660 screening mammograms from women in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. (Barlow et al.,
2006).
- Breast Histopathology Dataset consists of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens
scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 pixels x 50 pixels were extracted (198,738 IDC
negative and 78,786 IDC positive).
- Breast Ultrasound Dataset consists of breast ultrasound images from 600 female patients between the ages
of 25 and 75 years old. The dataset consists of 780 images with an average image size of 500 pixels x 500
pixels and each ultrasound is classified as ‘normal’, ‘benign’, or ‘malignant’. 

## Methods
- Risk Estimation prediction with Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Gradient Boosting
- Image Classification with Custom CNN and VGGNet

## Results
 - F1 Score of 21% for the best risk estimation model
 - F1 Score of over 90% for the best image classification models
